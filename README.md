Tools

This is a set of small utilities and tools that I have written
over the years as part of coaching work. They are mostly used for demonstration
purposes, but some have seen "live" action.

* jSupervisor - An Integration Test Framework wih Automated Mocking
* jWise - Pair-Wise Test Case Generation
